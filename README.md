Personal Finance Power BI Dashboard

A project built using Microsoft Power BI to analyze personal financial records and transform raw expense data into interactive, insightful dashboards.

"Data analysis isn‚Äôt just about showing numbers‚Äîit‚Äôs about uncovering a story and building context from raw information. True analytics goes beyond formulas and calculations; it‚Äôs about using data to drive real, meaningful change."
‚Äî Chris Dutton, Maven Analytics

Problem Statement

For a few years, I have been tracking my day-to-day expenses in Microsoft Excel. While Excel‚Äôs sorting and filtering functions provided a basic overview, they lacked depth for advanced analysis. To gain richer insights, I decided to convert my static spreadsheets into dynamic dashboards using Power BI.

Project Objectives

The dashboards aim to answer the following questions:

What are my monthly spending trends for each year?

How much do I spend by category?

Can I view a detailed list of expenses with comments?

How much is spent across different purchase locations?

What is the distribution of purchases across price ranges?

What do my quarterly and weekly spending patterns look like?

What are my average daily, weekly, and monthly expenses?

How do food costs compare with restaurant costs?

How does my spending change when I‚Äôm sick?

How does weekend spending differ from weekdays?

Before building visuals, I mapped out the required measures and drafted a rough dashboard layout.

Analysis Summary

I developed multiple dashboards to explore these questions. Sample views:

About Microsoft Power BI

Power BI is Microsoft‚Äôs business intelligence platform that enables data import, modeling, and visualization. First launched in 2011, it has steadily evolved with new features added monthly. It can be used both locally via Power BI Desktop or online through Power BI Service. While somewhat similar to Excel, Power BI makes it much easier to create interactive and visually engaging dashboards.

Repository Structure
Finance_Data/20xx

Contains monthly Excel files of expenses, covering Aug 2018 ‚Äì Dec 2020.

change_excel_sheets.py

Python script that renames multiple Excel sheet tabs to ‚ÄúSheet1‚Äù for smoother Power BI integration.

Finance_Data.xlsx

The original Excel workbook where I tracked spending.

Personal_Finance_Dashboard.pbix

The Power BI file containing all dashboards and visuals.

Data Collection

I manually entered expense data into Excel using purchase receipts. The dataset includes Date, Category, Price, Location, and Comment.

Because my data was spread across multiple sheets within a workbook, I split them into individual Excel files to simplify Power BI imports.

Data Cleaning

Several preprocessing steps were required:

Category standardization: Fixed inconsistent category labels (e.g., ‚Äúhair cut‚Äù, ‚ÄúHair-Cut‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúHair Cut‚Äù).

Date formatting: Standardized mixed formats (Text, General, Date).

Null values: Removed rows with missing values, since they were minimal and did not affect results.

Measures & Visuals

To answer the research questions, I created three lookup tables:

Calendar Lookup ‚Äì Generated date ranges with derived fields such as month, quarter, week-ending, etc.

Item Lookup ‚Äì Contained unique categories; included a Boolean column to toggle rent on/off for analysis.

Location Lookup ‚Äì Unique purchase locations.

Using these, I built measures such as:

Total cost

Average daily/weekly/monthly cost

Purchase counts by price range

Flags for sick days, weekday/weekend spending

Key visuals include slicers for date, category, location, health status, weekday/weekend, and price ranges‚Äîoffering flexible granularity.

Conclusion

By leveraging Power BI, I transformed static expense logs into interactive dashboards, providing deeper insights into personal spending habits. These dashboards make it easier to identify trends, compare categories, and make informed financial choices.
